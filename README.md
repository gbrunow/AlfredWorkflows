# AlfredWorkflows
Just some alfred workflows , create by myself .

1. Say Words : tap `say hello`, your computer will say hello by voice .
2. FTP Switcher : open or close your system's ftp server .

### UPDATE
* Say Words now support real man pronounce, but you need connect to Google(翻墙), and say words just support a word, not words!
